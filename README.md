# landing-page
landing page repo for top

Laying the foundation of the page was simple and straightforward. Getting the foundations of the styling was fairly simple to do as well, following the guide given to us by TOP. 

The most difficult part of the project was getting flexbox to get position everything the way I had wanted it. Getting the main body of each block centered to the page while maintaining that spacing between the child elements was difficult for me to get right.
